Sec. 94-518. - Nonconforming parking.
Improvements to existing nonconforming parking areas shall comply with the following limitations and restrictions:
1. Aesthetic or life extending treatments. All work proposed for parking areas which includes aesthetic applications or
service life-extending treatments shall require compliance with minimum traffic/pedestrian control measures, ADA
compliance, and stall painting detail. Life-extending treatments include, but are not limited to, seal coating, microsurfacing and slurry coating. The configuration of the parking stalls shall comply with the regulations of this chapter.
The development services director shall have flexibility in requiring compliance with the regulations of this chapter
when, due to other existing nonconformities or conditions, strict compliance is not practical or feasible and such
flexibility will not negatively impact the surrounding properties or area.
2. Material improvements. All material improvements to a nonconforming parking area will require the parking area to
come into full compliance with the zoning and land development regulations. The extent of compliance shall be
determined by the development service director. Material improvements include full depth reclamation, base restabilization, milling and resurfacing, overlay curbing, drainage improvements, or facility expansion.
