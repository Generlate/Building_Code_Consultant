Sec. 94-53. - Unsafe buildings and structures.
Should the building official determine that a historic property or a property within a historic district is unsafe pursuant to the
city's building and housing code, the historic preservation division shall be notified of such findings. Where reasonably
feasible, within applicable laws and regulations, the building official shall endeavor to have the resource repaired rather
than demolished and shall take into account any comments and recommendations by the board. The board may take
appropriate actions to effect and accomplish the preservation of the resource, including, but not limited to, negotiations
with the owner and other interested parties, provided that such actions do not interfere with the city's building and housing
code.
