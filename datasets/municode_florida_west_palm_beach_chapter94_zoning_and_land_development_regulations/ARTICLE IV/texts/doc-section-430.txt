Sec. 94-124. - North Railroad Avenue district (NoRA).
a. Intent. The intent of the North Railroad Avenue District (NoRA) is to establish an urban district that adapts the
neighborhood into a walkable, mixed-use district. It is located between the FEC Railroad right-of-way and North
Dixie Highway, south of Palm Beach Lakes Boulevard and north of North Quadrille Boulevard where the industrial
character of the FEC Railroad, less conventional and more intense housing types and commercial uses co-exist.
The NORA District's Goals are to:
1. Improve the relationship between low-density residential neighborhoods and adjacent commercial corridors
by creating appropriate transitions of scale and height and introducing new uses compatible with the existing
neighborhood.
2. Increase the residential and commercial densities and intensities through compact and vibrant development
to ensure the District's land uses provide a functional critical mass that supports a vibrant mixed-use,
walkable environment responding to its proximity to the Downtown core.
3. Improve and extend the accessibility and use of streets as open spaces via infrastructure improvements with
adequate pedestrian crossings and shaded pedestrian routes. This will benefit the neighborhood and
adjacent commercial corridors with inviting streets to access and activate ground floor uses.
4. Ensure that private development contributes to enhanced infrastructure while improving the public realm’s
accessibility, quality, and safety.
b. Development characteristics.
1. Off-site parking in a centralized location is encouraged.
2. Compact mixed-use development is encouraged.
3. On North Railroad Avenue, ground floors are encouraged to be designed with a unique industrial character,
which may include working storefronts, garage doors, oversized fenestration, and unusual building materials.
4. Live work uses are encouraged.
5. Building massing should protect the scale of the small-scale residential streets.
6. Boutique hotels are the preferred hotel typology.
7. A variety of scales, volumes, facade rhythm, and architecture is encouraged.
c. NoRA subdisticts shall include: NoRA-5 and NoRA-2.
d. Subdistrict requirements. Developments shall comply with the following:
1. Table IV-28: NoRA-5
2. Table IV-29: NoRA-2
e. Additional subdistrict requirements.
1. Open space.
a. When possible, the public open space requirement shall be aligned with street ends that terminate at
the railroad right-of-way.
