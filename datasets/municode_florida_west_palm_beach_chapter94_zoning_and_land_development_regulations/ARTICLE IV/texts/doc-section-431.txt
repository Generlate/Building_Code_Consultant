Sec. 94-125. - Loftin district (LD).
a. Intent. The Loftin district (LD) is envisioned as a mixed-use district with an emphasis on auxiliary office and
residential uses compatible with the alternative uses in the industrial chic, Brelsford Park and Providencia Park. The
LD will provide a transition from the northern residential enclave planning area to the QGD and the ICD. Proposed
developments in this district should maintain the medium scale of the existing building stock, should have a quasiindustrial character, and provide special attention to residential entrances with creative shading devices, change in
building materials, and larger window openings.
b. Development characteristics.
1. Dixie Highway will anchor the district as the primary commercial corridor with wide sidewalks and high quality
storefront designs to promote pedestrian activity.
2. Ground floor active uses are encouraged on Olive Avenue.
3. All building frontages facing or oriented towards consolidated public open space should have active uses.
c. LD subdistricts shall include: LD-10, LD-5, LD-4 and LD-R.
d. Subdistrict requirements. Developments shall comply with the following:
1. Table IV-30: LD-10.
2. Table IV-31: LD-5.
3. Table IV-32: LD-4.
4. Table IV-33: LD-R.
e. Additional subdistrict requirements.
1. Open space.
a. Consolidated public open space. The open space requirement for multiple proposed developments may
be consolidated into one centralized open space for the entire district subject to the following
requirements:
1. Consolidated public open space shall be located within the district.
2. The public open space shall be developed by one entity. One entity shall be defined as either a
single owner or a group of owners which form a legal partnership for the purpose of consolidating
their open space requirements.
3. Consolidated public open space shall be developed and open for use prior to issuance of the first
certificate of occupancy of the building or buildings for which the open space is required.
4. Provisions for the maintenance of the open space shall be determined and documented in a
written agreement with the city prior to the issuance of the first certificate of occupancy.
5. Consolidated public open space shall satisfy the open space standards described in section 94109.
2. Building placement.
a. New buildings shall be sited in a manner so as to result in the maximum distance from adjacent
residential structures.
b. Towers shall be oriented towards Dixie Highway and away from the lower scale neighborhoods to the
east.
