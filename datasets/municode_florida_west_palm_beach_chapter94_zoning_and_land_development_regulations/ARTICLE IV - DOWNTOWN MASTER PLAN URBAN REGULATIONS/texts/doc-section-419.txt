entrances, adjacent sidewalks, and paths, at a minimum of 0.6 footcandles as measured at the back edge of the
curb and one foot above the sidewalk. This measurement shall include light emanating from public and private
sources. Unshielded light fixtures shall be prohibited.
c. Site visibility triangle requirements. Landscaping shall be installed in accordance with the clear vision requirements
of subsection 94-305(e). However, for downtown master plan purposes, the setback measurement shall be from the
back of curb, except in R subdistricts, where it shall be measured from the property line.
d. Streetscape requirements. Streetscapes shall be designed to provide consistency for each corridor, as established
by the street hierarchy and district character. Required building setbacks shall be designed to include features such

2. Street trees. Street trees shall be installed adjacent to the curb at a maximum of 30 feet on center along all
streets. Adjustments may be authorized by planning staff due to site constraints. Tree species shall be
approved by the city's landscape planner, and shade trees shall be preferred. Smaller tree species shall be
spaced closer together as appropriate to provide continuous tree canopy over the sidewalk. Trees shall be a
minimum of 20 feet in height, and have a minimum of eight feet clear trunk, or as approved by the city.
