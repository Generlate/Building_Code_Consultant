Sec. 94-128. - Northwest neighborhood district (NWD).
a. Intent. As one of the first historic districts in the city and one of the few intact single-family residential neighborhoods
in the downtown, the intent of the NWD is to preserve its existing residential scale and provide for open space
created through setback requirements. The historic character of the district shall be preserved and enhanced
through rehabilitation and adaptive reuse for commercial, low-scale multifamily, and mixed-uses along Tamarind
Avenue, Rosemary Avenue, and Palm Beach Lakes Boulevard. Infill housing is encouraged as an opportunity to
promote attainable and workforce housing options. Extending Douglas and Division Avenues south will enhance the
district's connectivity to the urban core planning area.
The revitalization of the historic mixed-used corridors in the neighborhood, such as Tamarind Avenue and
Rosemary Avenue, shall be encouraged and developed in a low to medium scale compatible with the single-family
structures. Within these corridors, the future development of the existing vacant parcels or the renovation of existing
structures shall respect the scale and character of the historic Northwest Neighborhood while creating new
commercial and residential activity that serves the neighborhood and promotes its connection with the downtown
core and surrounding areas.
b. Development characteristics.
1. Development characteristics for the NWD-8, NWD-5, NWD-4, NWD-2, and NWD-2C subdistricts:
a. Residential buildings should have an urban character and may include walk-up units with individual
entrances and mail service.
b. The preservation of eligible or contributing historic structures is encouraged.
c. Adaptive reuse of existing structures is encouraged to preserve the historic building stock and promote
creative uses.
d. The ground floor should promote pedestrian activity and a low scale residential character.
e. Proposed developments should have historic and vernacular characteristics which are harmonious with
the historic character.
f. Proposed developments are encouraged to include wrap around verandas or porches, canopies, and
wood siding.
g. Proposed development shall be developed in a low to medium scale to be compatible with the scale
and character of the existing neighborhood. Special attention shall be given to the transition between
the low and medium scale developments to ensure the character of the neighborhood is maintained.
2. Development characteristics for the NWD-R-C1 subdistrict:
a. Historic preservation of eligible and contributing historic structures is encouraged.
b. Proposed developments should have historic and vernacular characteristics which are harmonious with
the existing historic buildings.
c. Proposed developments are encouraged to include wrap around verandas or porches, canopies, and
wood siding.
d. Outdoor recreational uses or outdoor markets are encouraged as temporary uses for the existing
surface parking lots.
c. NWD subdistricts shall include: NWD-8, NWD-5, NWD-4, NWD-2, NWD-2C, and NWD-R-C1.
d. Subdistrict requirements. Developments shall comply with the following:
1. Table IV-35a: NWD-8.
2. Table IV-36: NWD-5.
3. Table IV-37: NWD-4.
4. Table IV-38: NWD-2.
