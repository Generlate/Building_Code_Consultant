Sec. 94-132. - Transfer of development rights program.
a. Intent. The TDR program is a tool to promote the preservation of historic properties and the creation of urban open
space. The TDR program allows the transfer of unused development rights from historic properties or newly created
urban open spaces, called sending sites, to receiving sites within the DMP area.
b. Applicable area. The TDR program shall apply to qualified properties located within the DMP area. A property is
deemed qualified to participate in the TDR program if it is designated as an eligible sending site or receiving site on
Figure IV-35 Sending and Receiving Sites and/or Table IV-41 Eligible Sending sites. Additional sites may qualify as
sending sites in accordance with Section 94-132(c). Receiving site eligibility is also determined by the special
incentive programs set forth in Section 94-133 and the DMP housing incentive program set forth in Section 94-134.
c. Sending site requirements. To qualify as a sending site, a property shall comply with all the requirements set forth in
this section as follows:
1. Historic property sending site.
A. Designation as an individual historic property or contributing to a historic district according to section 9448.
B. Completion of renovation according to the standards set forth in sections 94-45 through 94-49
pertaining to historic preservation and inspection approval by the historic preservation division.
C. All improvements or renovations shall have passed all applicable final building permit inspections.
2. Landmark sending sites (local or national register landmark status).
A. Designation as an individual historic landmark or contributing to a historic landmark district according to
section 94-48 or in accordance with the national landmarks program.
B. Completion of renovation according to the standards set forth in sections 94-45 through 94-49
pertaining to historic preservation and inspection approval by the historic preservation division.
C. All improvements or renovations shall have passed all applicable final building permit inspections.
3. Clematis Street conservation district sending site.
A. Completion of all renovations according to the secretary of interior's standards for the rehabilitation and
guidelines for rehabilitating historic buildings.
B. All improvements or renovations shall have passed all applicable final building permit inspections.
4. Urban open space sending site.
A. Ownership by the City of West Palm Beach.
B. Designation as urban open space in Figure 3 of the Zoning Atlas.
C. Completion of all improvements to the property according to the urban open space standards in section
94-109.
5. NoRA-Brelsford Park district special TDR sending area. Due to the special characteristics of the NoRA and
Brelsford Park districts, and with the goal to maintain the character of the area, certain properties within the
NoRA district and the Brelsford Park district are allowed to transfer their unused development capacity to
other receiving sites within the NoRa district in compliance with the following conditions:
i. NoRA-Brelsford Park legacy structure sending site.
a. Completion of all building renovations, reconstruction or new construction maintaining the defining
characteristics of the NoRA district or the Brelsford Park district.

Zoning and Land Development Code

Page 1

a. Completions of all improvements to the site according to the off-site accessory surface parking lot
standards permitted within the district.
b. All improvements shall have passed all applicable final building permit inspections.
6. Sites with previously purchased or sold TDRs.
A. A receiving site that has acquired TDRs pursuant to the city's TDR program may transfer all or a portion
of its unused TDRs to a new eligible receiving site following the transfer process established in this
section.
B. The certificate of transfer originally issued for the site shall be amended to reflect the amended capacity
and recorded against the original receiving site and the new receiving site in the city's TDR register and
the county
public records.
C. A sending site with designated historic structures which are no longer in their original location is eligible
for repurchase of the square footage of the TDRs previously sold from another eligible site. Prior to
utilization of those purchased TDRs, the site shall have received both approval of and successful
completion of relocation of all historic buildings to a more suitable site. Repurchased square footage
shall comply with the current
site maximum development capacity.
D. Historic properties which have sold their development rights may repurchase development rights to the
maximum allowed under the current zoning regulations. Any work on the site shall comply with the
Secretary of Interior standards.
7. TDR calculations.
A. The amount of development rights that can be transferred from a sending site shall be calculated by
multiplying the lot area by the FAR allowed in the base zoning identified in the building requirement
table minus the total square footage of the existing structure located on the property. The amount shall
not include the calculation of any additional FAR derived from an incentive program.
B. For properties which received historic designation prior to June 29, 2009, the amount of development
rights that may be transferred from a sending site shall be calculated by multiplying the lot area by the
number of stories permitted by right in accordance with the 1995 downtown master plan, minus the total
square footage of the existing structure located on the property.
C. The TDR calculation shall only include the eligible historic structure unless it is determined by the city's
historic preservation planner that the related surrounding land is important for the preservation of the
building's context.
D. For properties which receive landmark designation, the amount of development rights transferred by the
city shall be calculated by multiplying the lot area by the FAR allowed in the base zoning identified in
the building
requirement table.
E. For a landmark sending site which exceeds the square footage that would be permitted under the
existing development capacity, the total amount of development capacity may be utilized for the
purpose of calculating the city's landmark TDR incentive.
F. For properties that do not have a specific FAR assigned, the amount of development rights that can be
transferred shall be calculated by multiplying the lot’s area by each floor’s maximum allowed building
footprint according to the corresponding building requirements table.
8. Table IV-41 Eligible Sending sites identifies sites that include buildings eligible for historic designation. The
list is not all inclusive and additional sites may be identified according to the provisions of this section.
Identification as an eligible sending site does not guarantee the availability of TDRs or eligibility for
historic designation, as the requirements of section 94-132(c) remain applicable.
d. Transfer process.
1. Letter of availability. Once the eligibility of the sending site is established by the development services
director or zoning administrator, a letter which reflects an estimate of the development rights available for
transfer from the sending site may be issued by the planning division upon request.
2. Registry of TDRs. A TDR registry maintained by the city will record the total amount of development rights
available on a site, and the date and amount of any transfer that occurs.

Zoning and Land Development Code

Page 2

3. TDR transfer application. An application for the transfer of development rights from a sending to a receiving
site shall be submitted to the planning division, on cityapproved forms, for review.
4. Certificate of transfer. Once an application for the transfer of development rights has been submitted, the City
will verify compliance with the program requirements. If compliance with all program requirements is found,
the city will issue a certificate of transfer which reflects the development rights being transferred from
the sending to the receiving site. Certificates of transfer will be numbered and shall be recorded against the
sending site and the receiving site in the city's TDR register and the county public records. The TDR
certificate shall describe the adjusted development rights of the sending site and receiving site, shall run with
the land, shall be binding on successors, heirs and assigns, and shall require the joinder of all mortgagees of
record. Execution and recording of the TDR certificate is required for the TDR transfer to be effective.
5. A TDR certificate shall not be issued unless the sending site has completed all the required improvements
and it has passed all required inspections according to Section 94-132(c).
6. Banking of TDRs. TDRs may be acquired from a sending site and held for an undetermined amount of time
until a suitable receiving site is found. City approval of the receiving site shall be obtained in order to utilize
such TDRs.
e. Receiving site requirements. To be eligible as a receiving site, a property shall comply with the following conditions:
1. The property is depicted as a TDR receiving site on Figure IV-35.
2. The maximum number of development rights which a receiving site can receive is shown in Figure IV-35 and
the corresponding incentive building requirements table.
3. For properties on which future ROW is indicated on Figure 4 of the Zoning Atlas, and that elect to use an
incentive program, the following requirements apply:
A. Any new ROW setback and/or land dedication indicated in Figure 4 of the Zoning Atlas shall be
provided as required in the corresponding incentive building requirement table. The setback area and/or
land dedications shall become part of the public right-of-way or shall include a public access easement.
B. The setback area and/or land dedications may be included as part of the lot area for the purposes of
calculating the FAR.
C. The setback area and/or land dedications shall be excluded as part of all other building requirement
calculations.
D. Underground parking shall be permitted under the new ROW setback and/or land dedication.
E. Proposed developments shall not be permitted to build over the new ROW setback and/or land
dedication.
4. Receiving sites use restrictions:
A. Except for residential uses, and as specifically established under this section or by a special incentive,
sites designated as TDR receiving sites in Figure IV-35 may be utilized for any uses as permitted by
section 94-105 - Use requirements and section 94-106 - General uses with special requirements.
B. Projects utilizing the TDR program for the construction of residential uses are only eligible to receive
TDRs in compliance with the requirement of the DMP housing incentive program set forth in section 94134.
C. For properties designated as OBD 5-25 receiving site, TDR eligibility is limited to the development of
class A office uses, and development shall follow the standards prescribed by the Okeechobee
Business District incentive set forth in section 94-133.
D. For properties designated as NWD-3-8 receiving site, TDR eligibility is limited to the development of
residential uses, and development shall follow the standards prescribed by the Northwest neighborhood
workforce housing incentive set forth in section 94-133.
5. The amount of development rights that may be transferred to a receiving site is calculated by multiplying the
lot area by the additional FAR allowed in the corresponding incentive building requirement table, as indicated
by Figure IV-35.
6. Projects seeking to utilize the additional height offered by the TDR incentive program but not needing
additional FAR may increase the height to the maximum permitted by the corresponding incentive building
requirement table as long as all the square footage contained in any of the additional floors permitted by
the incentive building requirement table is fully obtained from TDRs.

Zoning and Land Development Code

7. Proposed developments which receive site plan approval utilizing the benefits of the TDR program must
obtain city approval for the transfer of development rights and must possess the certificate of transfer before
the site plan approval expires.
