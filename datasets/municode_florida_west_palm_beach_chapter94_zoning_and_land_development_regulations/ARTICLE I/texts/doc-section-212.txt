Sec. 94-10. - Financial debts and obligations owed to the city.
No applications will be processed by the city, and no reviews will be conducted by the city, until an applicant has first
shown that the applicant is not financially indebted to the city for any reason, including, but not limited to, ad valorem
property taxes, special assessments, city utility charges, and other government-imposed liens. This section does not
apply to those loans with the city that are current in payment. Furthermore, this section may be waived by the city upon a
showing by the applicant that the review is a necessary prerequisite for bringing a property that is out of compliance with
this Code into compliance with this Code.
