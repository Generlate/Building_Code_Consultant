Sec. 94-401. - Scope, purpose and intent.
a. Scope. The regulations set forth shall in this article apply to and govern signs in all districts. No sign shall be
erected or maintained unless it is in compliance with the regulations governing content, size, location and other sign
characteristics for the district in which it is located.
b. Purpose and intent. It is the intent of this article to:
1. Create a healthier residential and business environment by improving the visual quality of the city.
2. To promote traffic safety by protecting motorists from the distracting visual clutter of excessive signage. The
regulations contained in this article restrict signage primarily to that which is an accessory use and not a
principal use.
It is also the intent of this article to secure and preserve unto the people of the city the right of free expression guaranteed
by the First Amendment of the Constitution of the United States; hence this article shall be so construed as to effectuate
such intent.
