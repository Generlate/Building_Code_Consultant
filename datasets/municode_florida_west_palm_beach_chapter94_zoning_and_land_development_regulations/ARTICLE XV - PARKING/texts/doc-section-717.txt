Sec. 94-483. - Parking and loading requirements for multifamily and nonresidential
uses.
a. Site plan review for off-site parking facilities. No off-site parking facilities shall be constructed unless a site plan has
been reviewed and approved in accordance with the provisions of ARTICLE II of this chapter.
b. Retention of required parking and loading spaces. Required off-street parking and loading spaces shall not be
replaced by any other uses unless equal parking and loading facilities are provided elsewhere. Off-street parking
and loading spaces, existing at the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived, in connection
with the operation of an existing building or use, shall not be reduced to an amount less than required for a similar
new building or new use of the same type.
c. Collective provision of parking and loading spaces. Two or more buildings or uses on adjacent lots collectively may
provide required off-street parking and loading facilities. In such cases, the required number of parking and loading
spaces shall not be less than the sum of the requirements for the individual uses computed separately.
