Sec. 94-272. - Permitted use table.
a. Generally. Uses as regulated in this section shall be determined as provided in the Permitted Use Table, Table IX-1.
Uses in the permitted use table are classified as the following:
1. Uses permitted by right (P). Uses allowed throughout a district as a matter of right, subject to all applicable
provisions of this chapter. These uses are designated by a "P" in Table IX-1.
2. Uses permitted by right, subject to extra requirements (PXRs). Uses allowed throughout a district, yet subject
to certain extra requirements not applicable to other uses in that district. Uses of this nature may be
established with planning and zoning administrator approval and issuance of a zoning certificate. The extra
requirements applicable to specific uses are subject to section 94-273. These uses are designated "PXR" in
Table IX-1.
3. Special uses (Class A and Class B). Uses normally not allowed within a district that warrant consideration on
a case-by-case basis to enable mitigation of potential detrimental effects on uses permitted as of right in the
district. However, special uses may be allowed under circumstances particular to the proposed location and
subject to standards and conditions which provide protection to nearby uses and properties. All special uses
are governed by the standards in subsection 94-36(e). These uses are designated "Sa" or "Sb" in Table IX-1.
b. Establishment of use regulations. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, regulations governing the use of
land and structure are hereby established as shown in the "Permitted Use Table." Uses not expressly permitted are
prohibited.
c. Permitted uses within all districts. Within all districts there are certain uses permitted as a matter of right that are not
listed on the permitted use table. These uses are aboveground and buried utility lines for local distribution of
electricity, telephone, and cable television service; accessory and appurtenances apparatus such as poles, guy
wires, transformers, and switching boxes; public and private streets and roads; railroad rights-of-way; water and
sanitary sewer lines; gas and liquid fuel distribution lines; and public water canals.
d. Planned community and planned development districts. Uses allowed in the planned development and planned
community districts shall be as provided in section 94-206 (planned community district) and section 94-207
(planned development district).
