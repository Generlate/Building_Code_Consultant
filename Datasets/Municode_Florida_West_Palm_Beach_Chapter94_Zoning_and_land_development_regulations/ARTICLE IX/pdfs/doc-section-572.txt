3. Special uses (Sa and Sb).

and the exact nature of the use. Section 94-273 provides detailed requirements for uses, which specify permitted
uses, and any additional application requirements or additional standards that may be necessary to justify and
establish each use. Each use listed in this portion of the article is referenced by an item number corresponding to its
location in the permitted use table.

Each master use listed in APPENDIX A is referenced by item number to its corresponding use in the permitted use
