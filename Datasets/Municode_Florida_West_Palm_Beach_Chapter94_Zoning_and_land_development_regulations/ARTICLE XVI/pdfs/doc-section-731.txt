Sec. 94-513. - Lots of record.
a. Any lot of record which is not in conformance with the current dimensional and/or area standards of the zoning and
land development regulations may be built upon. The lot shall conform to the other standards and requirements of
this chapter.
b. When contiguous lots of record exist under single ownership, such lots may be considered an undivided parcel for
the purposes of development and land use regulation. The recordation in the public records of Palm Beach County
of an instrument to unify the parcels, in form approved by the office of the city attorney, may be required. No portion
of such unified parcels shall be used or sold in a manner which diminishes compliance with the dimensional
requirements of this chapter.
c. Lots or portions of lots shall not be subdivided by sale, or otherwise, so as to create a new dimensional
nonconformity or to increase an existing dimensional nonconformity. Multiple platted lots titled as a single parcel
within a residential zoning district may be subdivided into minimum 50-foot wide lots, provided such subdivision
occurs along an originally platted lot line, except for lots located in the area described in subsection 94-71(d)(2).
Multiple platted lots within a residential zoning district located in the area described in subsection 94-71(d)(2) and
titled as a single parcel may only be subdivided into minimum 75-foot wide lots.
