Sec. 94-86. - Historic residential district definitions.
The definitions below apply specifically to the residential historic districts within the City of West Palm Beach.
Block face is one side of a street between two consecutive intersections, for example a block face can be one side of a

city block.
Building footprint is the ground floor surface area of a structure or structures on a site as measured from the structure's

exterior walls.
Corner side setback is the amount of space required for a building to be located away from the property line on the portion

of the lot that is wider and adjacent to a public right-of-way.
Finished grade means the elevation or the surface of the earth after all earthwork has been completed including fill or

berming.
Floor area ratio (FAR) is a regulatory technique, generally expressed in numeric fashion, which relates total developable

site area and the size (square feet) of development permitted on a specific site. For purposes of historic residential
districts, the assigned floor area ratio determines the total gross square feet of each floor of all structures as measured
from the structure's exterior walls based upon the actual land area of the parcel upon which the structures are to be
located. Total gross square feet calculated using the assigned floor area ratio shall include 100 percent of the floor area of
all roofed structures enclosed by solid walls on more than two sides (not enclosed by more than 75 percent of wall
surface) and 50 percent of the floor area of all roofed structures that are attached to a principal or accessory structure and
are enclosed by walls on two sides or less. If structures are enclosed at a later time, their floor area shall be counted
towards the total FAR as defined below. Total gross square feet calculated using the assigned floor area ratio includes
100 percent of the floor area of the following structures and building elements:



Accessory structures such as sheds, guest houses and second units that are roofed and enclosed on more than
two sides whether or not they include habitable space;



Attached and detached garages;



Mezzanine and loft areas;



Stairways: The floor areas used by interior and roofed exterior stairways, elevators, escalators and similar
features. The floor area of each run of stairs shall be counted once. The floor area of usable spaces having a
five-foot minimum height under a run of stairs shall be counted;



Utility areas: The floor area of laundry rooms, mechanical rooms, closets, storage rooms and built-in cabinets.

Total gross square feet calculated using the assigned floor area ratio includes 50 percent of the floor area of the following
structures and building elements:



Roofed but open carports that are attached to a principal or accessory structure but not enclosed by solid walls
on more than two sides;



Roofed but open porches that are attached to a principal or accessory structure but not enclosed by solid walls
on more than two sides;



Roofed but open breezeways that are attached to a principal or accessory structure but not enclosed by solid
walls on more than two sides.

Total gross square feet calculated using the assigned floor area ratio does not include any of the floor area of the
following structures and building elements:



Half story spaces that are not habitable (attics);



Terraces and balconies that are not roofed;



Free-standing patios, decks and gazebos that are roofed but not enclosed by solid walls on more than one side
and not attached to a principal or accessory structure;



Awnings;



Up to three feet of primary or accessory structure roof overhangs or eaves without structural support members.

Front facade means, for historic preservation purposes, the exterior facade, including multiple planes thereof, of a building,

site or structure which faces the public right-of-way. For corner lots, this refers to the facade associated with the narrowest
portion of the parcel.
Lot coverage (LC) means a regulatory technique, generally expressed in numeric fashion, which relates total developable

site area and the building footprint (square feet) of development permitted on a specific site. For purposes of historic
residential districts, the assigned lot coverage determines the total building footprint based upon the actual land area of
the parcel upon which the structures are to be located. Building footprint calculated using the assigned lot coverage shall
include 100 percent of the ground floor area of all roofed structures enclosed by solid walls on more than two sides and 50
percent of the ground floor area of all roofed structures that are attached to a principal or accessory structure and are
enclosed by walls on two sides or less. If structures are enclosed at a later time, their building footprint shall be counted
towards the total LC as defined below. Building footprint calculated using the assigned lot coverage includes 100 percent
of the ground floor area of the following structures and building elements:



Accessory structures such as sheds, guest houses and second units that are roofed and enclosed on more than
two sides whether or not they include habitable space;




Attached and detached garages;



Utility areas: The ground floor area of laundry rooms, mechanical rooms, closets, storage rooms and built-in
cabinets.

Stairways: The ground floor of interior and roofed exterior stairways, elevators, escalators and similar features.
The ground floor area of usable spaces having a 5' minimum height under a run of stairs shall be counted;

Building footprint calculated using the assigned lot coverage includes 50 percent of the ground floor area of the following
structures and building elements:



Roofed but open carports that are attached to a principal or accessory structure but not enclosed by solid walls
on more than two sides;



Roofed but open porches that are attached to a principal or accessory structure but not enclosed by solid walls
on more than two sides;



Roofed but open breezeways that are attached to a principal or accessory structure but not enclosed by solid
walls on more than two sides.

Building footprint calculated using the assigned lot coverage does not include any of the ground floor area of the following
structures and building elements:



Free-standing patios, decks and gazebos that are roofed but not enclosed by solid walls on more than one side
and not attached to a principal or accessory structure.

Natural grade means the site grade unaffected by construction techniques such as fill or berming.
Principal structure means the primary habitable structure on a lot.
Stepback means a horizontal offset above the first floor in a vertical building wall.
Walls, solid are permanent walls more than three feet in height that are composed of a solid materials, including

transparent window areas, for more than 25 percent of the wall plane. The following shall not be considered as solid walls:





Walls composed of open lattice;
Walls composed of louvered blinds; or
Solid railings that are three feet or less in height.
