Sec. 94-485. - General provisions.
a. Restriction on use of parking and loading areas. The storage of merchandise, materials or motor vehicles, or the
repair of motor vehicles or any other equipment is prohibited in all off-street and loading facilities.
b. Location of parking and loading spaces. Required off-street parking and loading spaces for multiple family
developments of three units or more (on one property), mixed-use projects and nonresidential structures shall be
located on the same property on which the use or structure exists unless compliant with the following:
1. Required parking may be located off-street on property meeting the following requirements:
a. Located within 300 feet of the subject property;
b. Located in the same or less restrictive zoning district;
c. Located in a district where such facilities are permitted;
d. Permitted subject to approval of a special use permit;
e. Parking shall be paved and marked in accordance with the appropriate city code requirements.
2. On-street parking directly and wholly abutting the subject property may be counted towards the parking
requirement, provided that:
a. Such spaces are clearly marked on the site plan and pavement in accordance with the appropriate city,
county and state standards;
b. Such spaces shall be publicly accessible and cannot be reserved or restricted by the owner or tenants
of the property;
c. On street parking on private streets may be counted towards required parking provided that the road is
publicly accessible (not gated) and the streets, parking spaces and sidewalks are constructed consist
with the standards for public streets in the city.
In the event the city, county or state removes the spaces at any time for a public purpose, the property shall
be considered lawfully nonconforming with respect to parking.
c. Ownership of parking and loading spaces. The title of all property on which required parking and loading is provided
shall be unified with the title of all property on which the uses served are located. Deed restrictions and other
documents which provide for title unification shall be recorded with the county clerk of the circuit court prior to
consideration of a site plan. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, required parking for any structure or use
may be located on property obtained on a lease, rental, or similar contractual basis when the city is a third part to
such agreement. Contractual agreements of this nature must be approved by the city commission following action
by the zoning board of appeals and prior to the issuance of any building permit or certificate of occupancy. If
required parking is obtained in this manner, sufficient numbers of spaces shall be maintained at all times. If required
parking is obtained on a contractual, non-unity of title basis, deed restrictions, or other documents which limit the
use of property to the provision parking shall be recorded with the clerk of the circuit court, approved by the city
attorney, and filed with the planning department prior to consideration of a site plan. Deed restrictions of this nature
shall expire only after 25 years or upon the termination of the use requiring the provision of parking. Parking
provided on a non-unity of title basis shall be a Class B special use and require approval by the zoning board of
appeals. Required documents shall be recorded with the clerk of the circuit court prior to issuance of any building
permit.
d. Entrances and exits to parking and loading facilities. Entrances and exits to parking and loading spaces shall be
located on one or the other:
1. Land in the same zoning district as the use served;
2. Land in a less restrictive zoning district.
For the purposes of this section, the zoning district listed first on the following list shall be considered the least
restrictive than the one preceding it:

e. Surfacing of parking and loading spaces. Prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy, all parking and loading
spaces, access drives, and maneuvering lanes shall be paved with a nondusting surface in compliance with
standards specified by the city. The planning director, in coordination with the city's engineers, may approve types
of paving not specified upon a finding that such other types are equivalent in appearance and durability. Parking
surfaces shall be maintained free of all weeds, grass, dust, and accumulated trash.
f. Storm drainage for parking and loading spaces. Off-street parking and loading spaces shall be provided with
drainage systems adequately designed and maintained as required by the following:
1. To prevent the accumulation of water from normal rainfall; and
2. To prevent the runoff of rainfall onto neighborhood property at rates greater than would result if the site were
undeveloped. Drainage systems shall be designed in accordance with standards prescribed by the city
engineering department.
g. Traffic control aids. Traffic control signs and pavement markings shall be used as necessary to ensure safe and
efficient traffic operations within all parking and loading areas. Required off-street parking spaces shall be
delineated by four inch white double striped lines. Curbs, wheel-stops, or bollards shall be installed to protect
landscaped areas, pedestrian area, buildings, and property lines. All signs shall comply with the Manual of Uniform
Traffic Control Devices Federal Highway Administration, United States Department of Transportation, 1978, as
adopted by the state department of transportation, as revised.
h. Required number of spaces when fractional space computed. When calculations determining the number of
required parking spaces result in the requirements of a fractional space, any fraction up to and including one-half
shall be disregarded and fractions over one-half shall require one parking space.
i. Developer's option to pay into city's parking trust fund in lieu of providing required parking spaces. Proposed
developments within the CC-2 districts may accommodate their required parking by making payment for each
required parking space into the downtown parking trust fund. The fee per parking space is based upon the current
construction cost of structured parking, as determined by the city parking administrator, and paid at the time of
building permit application. Payment-in-lieu does not provide a parking space for the development in any city facility.
j. Configuration of parking and loading ingress and egress. Ingress to and egress from parking and loading spaces
shall be provided in either of the following ways:
1. Ingress and egress from parking and loading spaces shall be provided by means of clearly defined drives
which lead from public rights-of-way to clearly defined maneuvering lanes which in turn provide access to
individual parking or loading spaces. Configurations which require backing directly onto a street, excluding
alleys, from a parking or loading space for more than two residential units and all nonresidential uses shall be
prohibited in all residential and nonresidential zoning districts. There shall be a minimum of ten feet
separation between all access drives. The separation shall be measured along the curbline.
2. Ingress and egress from parking stalls shall be provided directly from public alleys. If existing alley width does
not comply with minimum aisle requirements, additional parking space aisle or setbacks shall be required as
indicated in Figure XV-2.
