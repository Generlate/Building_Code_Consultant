Sec. 94-484. - Shared parking requirements.
a. Intent. The intent of this section is to permit a reduction in the total number of required parking spaces when
property is occupied by two or more uses which typically do not experience peak parking demands at the same
time.
b. Calculation of shared parking requirements. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection 94-481(c), when any land
or building is used for two or more distinguishable purposes as listed in this section, the minimum total number of
required parking spaces shall be determined by the following procedure:
1. Multiply the minimum parking requirement for each individual use as provided in section 94-486 by the
appropriate percentage listed in Table XV-1 for each of the five designated time periods.
2. Add the resulting sum for each of the five vertical columns for the table.
3. The minimum parking requirement is given by the highest sum resulting from subsection (b)(2) of this section.
4. Limitations.
a. Parking spaces which are reserved for use by specified individuals or classes of individuals shall not be
counted toward meeting parking requirements.
b. The provisions in this section shall not result in a reduction of more than 25 percent from the
requirements which would apply in the absence of this section.
