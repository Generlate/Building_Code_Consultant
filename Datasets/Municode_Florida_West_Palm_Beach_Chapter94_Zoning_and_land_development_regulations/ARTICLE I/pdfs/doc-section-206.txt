b. Boundaries. The boundaries of each district are designed and established as shown on the Zoning Atlas of the City
of West Palm Beach, Florida.
c. Relationship to land use categories in comprehensive plan. Table I-1 shows which zoning districts are consistent
with and implement the land use categories in the city comprehensive plan, future land use element.
d. Relationship to the future land use map. Special impact zone (SIZ) notation on the future land use map does not
reflect or change densities or intensities but is to ensure heightened site plan review and could be subject to more
restrictive site plan requirements. (see future land use element policies 1.7.4 and 1.7.5)
