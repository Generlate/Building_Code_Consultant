Sec. 94-6. - Restrictions upon land, air rights, water, and structure.
No building or structure shall be erected, reconstructed, or structurally altered, nor shall any building, land, water, or air
rights, over land be used for any purpose other than a use permitted in the district in which such building, land, water, or
air rights, are located. No buildings or land shall be used so as to produce greater heights, smaller yards, or less
unoccupied area, and no building shall be occupied by more families than prescribed in this chapter for such building for
the district in which it is located. No lot which is now or may be hereafter built upon as required in this chapter shall be so
reduced in area that the yards and open spaces will be smaller than prescribed by this article, and no yard, court, or open
space provided about any building for the purpose of complying with the provisions hereof shall be used as a yard, court,
or other open space for any other building.
