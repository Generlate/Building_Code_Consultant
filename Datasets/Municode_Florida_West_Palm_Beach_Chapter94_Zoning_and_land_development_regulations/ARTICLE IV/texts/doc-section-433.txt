Sec. 94-127. - Brelsford Park district (BPD).
a. Intent. As one of three single-family neighborhoods within the boundaries of the downtown, the intent of the
Brelsford Park district is to improve its quality with new infill development and renovation of existing structures.
While the majority of the building stock is one and two-story residential, new uses may include residential with
live/work, professional offices, and design-arts related uses. Dixie Highway is predominantly a commercial corridor
and should continue to develop as the main commercial corridor for Brelsford Park with low-scale buildings and a
mix of uses. Attainable and workforce housing shall also be encouraged.
b. Development characteristics.
1. For BPD-5:
a. Dixie Highway is the main commercial corridor in this district and shall support pedestrian activity by
providing a wide sidewalk, high quality storefront designs, landscaping, and canopies.
b. Towers shall be oriented toward Dixie Highway to protect the scale of the residential neighborhoods to
the east and west.
c. Buildings on Dixie Highway should vary in height to enhance the corridor's visual character.
2. For BPD-R:
a. All proposed developments should share a consistent scale with the existing building stock and shall be
predominantly two-story structures with partial third stories.
b. All proposed developments shall have a similar ratio of open space created through the setback
requirements, maximum lot area, and maximum footprint.
c. Front porches are encouraged to promote interaction between the semi-public open space and the
public realm.
d. Adaptive reuse is encouraged by permitting existing buildings to convert their area for commercial uses.
e. Maximum lot area limits the size of proposed developments to a scale which is appropriate to the
existing neighborhood.
f. Any new construction or renovation shall follow the design guidelines adopted by the city.
c. BPD subdistricts shall include: BPD-5 and BPD-R.
d. Subdistrict requirements. Developments shall comply with the following:
1. Table IV-34: BPD-5.
2. Table IV-35: BPD-R.
e. Additional subdistrict requirements.
1. Minimum lot area. Lots of record which existed prior to the adoption of these urban regulations may be
considered buildable without limitation to minimum lot size.
2. As of the effective date of this ordinance [Ordinance No. 4213-09], outdoor storage, along the east side of
Railroad Avenue, meeting the requirements on section 94-105 will be considered as a temporary use, and is
expected to be replaced with commercial or residential uses which are more compatible with the
neighborhood in the future.
