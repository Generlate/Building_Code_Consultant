Sec. 94-120. - Transit oriented development district (TOD).
a. Intent. The TOD district provides the opportunity for an exemplary pedestrian-friendly neighborhood with
sustainable and environmentally responsive buildings and infrastructure. The district's close proximity to public
transportation in an area of the downtown which is largely undeveloped will support a variety of multifamily housing
types for a broad range of incomes. The combination of accessibility to public transit and housing will shape this
district as an active mixed-use neighborhood. Connectivity will be enhanced through the introduction of new streets.
Proposed developments should promote walkable streets by providing ground floor active uses and open space
through reduced parking capacities.
b. Development characteristics.
1. Division and Douglas Avenues shall be extended, where possible, to reduce the overall length of the blocks
and enhance connectivity pursuant to section 94-133.
2. The open space requirement for multiple proposed developments may be consolidated into one centralized
open space for the entire district.
3. Buildings and infrastructure should be sustainable and responsive to the environment to support the district
as a sustainable neighborhood.
4. Mixed-income housing and service-oriented retail are encouraged to support the district as a sustainable
neighborhood.
5. Retail uses may include small neighborhood retailers such as small service retail, and destination retail such
as specialty retailers and grocery stores.
6. Pedestrian pathways should be used to enhance connectivity to transit, the Quadrille business district,
CityPlace, and Clematis Street.
7. Active uses are encouraged for all building frontages which face the Dreyfoos School's open space sending
site.
c. TOD subdistricts shall include: TOD-25, TOD-10, and TOD-8.
d. Subdistrict requirements. Developments shall comply with the following:
1. Table IV-21: TOD-25.
2. Table IV-22: TOD-10.
3. Table IV-23: TOD-8.
e. Additional subdistrict requirements.
1. Uses.
a. Ground floor residential, if provided, shall be raised a minimum of 18 inches above the sidewalk
elevation.
2. Building placement.
a. Towers shall be oriented toward Tamarind Avenue to frame the street and to reinforce the corridor as a
gateway to public transportation.
3. Open space.
a. Consolidated open space. The open space requirement for multiple proposed developments may be
consolidated into one centralized public open space for the entire development subject to the following
requirements:
i. Consolidated public open space shall be located within the district.
ii. The public open space shall be developed by one entity. One entity shall be defined as either a
single owner or a group of owners which form a legal partnership for the purpose of consolidating
their public open space requirements.
iii. Consolidated public open space shall be developed and open for use prior to issuance of a
certificate of occupancy of the building or buildings for which the public open space is required.

Zoning and Land Development Code

iv. Provisions for the maintenance of the open space shall be determined and documented in a
written agreement with the city prior to the issuance of the first certificate of occupancy.
v. Consolidated public open space shall be improved as a garden plaza pursuant to Table IV-7.
4. Parking.
a. Parking shall be provided pursuant to section 94-111 and Table IV-9. Requirements may be reduced up
to 25 percent.
b. Interim surface parking. Interim surface parking lots for phased developments shall be permitted subject
to the following conditions:
i. Interim surface parking lots shall comply with all general development standards.
ii. Interim lots shall be set back 20 feet from the lot line. The setback shall be improved as a
landscape buffer.
iii. A phased development site plan shall be submitted for design review and approval when the
proposed development is submitted to the Plans and Plats Review Committee (PPRC) for site
plan approval.
iv. Construction of interim lots shall commence only upon receipt of a building permit for the first
phase of the proposed development.
v. The surfacing, drainage, and striping of the interim surface parking lot shall comply with the
regulations of ARTICLE XV of the zoning and land development regulations.
