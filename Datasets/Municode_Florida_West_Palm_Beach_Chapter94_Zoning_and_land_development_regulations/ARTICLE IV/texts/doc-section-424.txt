Sec. 94-118. - Quadrille garden district (QGD).
a. Intent. The Quadrille garden district is intended to function as a transition zone between the Quadrille business
district and the waterfront. The greatest development intensity should be oriented towards Quadrille Boulevard to
create a signature mixed-use corridor. Development should respect the scale of the pedestrian streets, Dixie
Highway, and Olive Avenue. The preservation of existing Florida vernacular buildings is encouraged to
commemorate the architectural heritage of the city. High percentages of tree canopy and landscaping are
encouraged to provide a shaded public realm and a distinct garden character.
b. Development characteristics.
1. A high percentage of landscaping and tree canopy is encouraged to support the district's residential and
garden character.
2. Ground floor residential is encouraged to promote pedestrian activity.
3. Active use liners are encouraged to incorporate two-story ground floor residential walk-up units, loft units with
double height spaces, live/work units or traditional flats with oversized, inset balconies or outdoor areas to
enhance the garden character of the district.
4. Rooftop gardens are encouraged.
5. Active uses are encouraged for all building frontages which face the historic county courthouse site on Dixie
Highway.
c. QGD subdistricts shall include: QGD-25, QGD-10, and QGD-5.
d. Subdistrict requirements. Developments shall comply with the following:
1. Table IV-14: QGD-25.
2. Table IV-15: QGD-10.
3. Table IV-16: QGD-5.
e. Additional subdistrict requirements.
1. Uses.
a. Ground floor residential, if provided, shall be raised a minimum of 18 inches above the sidewalk
elevation.
2. Building placement.
a. Towers shall be oriented toward Quadrille to frame the street and protect the scale of Dixie Highway.
