Sec. 94-116. - ClearLake district (CLD).
a. Intent. The ClearLake district (CLD) is characterized by a mixture of high-rise office and residential buildings. This
district does not share the historic street grid pattern of the downtown; therefore, any new development is
encouraged, to the maximum extent possible, to provide a pedestrian connection between the intermodal site on
the east side of the district and Australian Avenue to the west.
Clearwater Drive shall have a high percentage of tree canopy to provide shade and promote walkability. In addition,
ground floor active uses and main building entrances are required on Clearwater Drive. A portion of the perimeter of
Clear Lake will have a formal pedestrian pathway to enhance the water as a pedestrian asset.
b. Development characteristics.
1. Limited building footprints, footprint separation and side setbacks provide view corridors and opportunities for
pedestrian connectivity across the district, especially between the intermodal transit site and Clear Lake.
2. Building amenities and entrances are encouraged to be located on the ground floor fronting Clearwater Drive
to increase visual connections to the waterfront and enhance the quality of the public space at the ground
floor.
3. Active uses are encouraged on all building facades fronting urban open space designations and on side
setbacks wherever possible.
4. Ground floor active uses are encouraged fronting all pedestrian pathways.
5. Shared pedestrian pathways between adjacent lots are encouraged in lieu of fences separating lots.
6. Variations in building height are encouraged to promote a diverse skyline.
7. Towers are encouraged to be oriented toward Clearwater Drive, whenever possible.
8. Use of generous terraces and balconies to integrate indoor space with outside environment and to maximize
water views is encouraged.
c. CLD subdistricts shall include: CLD-25.
d. Subdistrict requirements. Developments shall comply with Table IV-12.
e. Additional subdistrict requirements.
1. Uses.
a. Ground floor residential, if provided, shall be raised a minimum of 18 inches above the sidewalk
elevation.
2. Open space.
a. Required side setbacks shall provide pedestrian pathways to promote pedestrian connections to the
water and the intermodal site and to provide view corridors. These pathways shall have landscape
improvements as specified in the open space standards in section 94-109.
