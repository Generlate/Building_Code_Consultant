Sec. 94-111. - Parking and loading requirements.
a. Intent. The parking requirements shall reduce the visual impact of parking uses and encourage creative alternatives
to reduce the area dedicated to parking, avoid conflicts between vehicles and pedestrians, and preserve and
enhance pedestrian activity within the downtown.
b. General parking requirements.
1. Parking shall comply with Table IV-9. Uses not listed on this table shall comply with the parking requirements
according to Table XV-6.
2. Parking requirement calculations shall be based on net interior area.
3. Parking reductions may be combined. However, the combination shall not result in a reduction of more than
25 percent from the requirements which would apply in the absence of all reductions. Any parking reductions
above 25 percent of the required parking shall obtain DAC approval.
4. Guest parking shall comply with Table IV-9. Guest parking shall be designated and prominently marked onsite as "Guest Parking" and shall not be restricted in any manner to use by a single tenant, owner, unit, or
other user.
5. Within the urban core and special districts planning areas, lots which are less than 55 feet in lot frontage are
not required to provide parking.
6. Any portion of the parking area which exceeds the maximum parking ratio shall be included in the
calculations of gross building area. This shall include stalls and all associated circulation areas.
7. Parking spaces for disabled shall be provided according to subsection 94-485(o).
c. Parking stall dimensions. Parking stall dimensions shall comply with the general parking standards according to
Figure XV-2 in section 94-485. Additional requirements are as follows:
1. In those cases where the side of any stall is adjacent to a wall, fence, building, or other physical obstruction,
the stall widths shall be increased by a minimum of one foot. Where there is an obstruction on both sides of
the stall, the stall widths shall be increased by a minimum of two feet.
2. A minimum three-foot back up area shall be provided at the terminus of any dead-end drive aisle to allow for
vehicles to safely pull out of the end parking spaces. In addition, the equivalent of one parking space at the
terminus of a dead-end aisle shall be striped as a dedicated pull-in area for turning around.
d. Shared parking. Shared parking is permitted in all planning areas. For proposed developments with two or more
distinguishable uses as listed in Table IV-10, the minimum total number of required parking spaces shall be
determined by the following procedure:
Minimum parking spaces required by the shared parking calculation shall not be marked as designated spaces for a
particular use.
1. Utilize Table IV-9 to determine the minimum parking requirement for each individual use.
2. Multiply the minimum parking requirement for each individual use by the appropriate percentage for each of
the five designated time periods listed in Table IV-10.
3. Add the resulting minimum parking requirement for each of the five designated time periods to obtain five
totals of minimum parking requirements.
4. The minimum parking requirement shall be the highest sum among the five columns resulting from the above
calculation.
e. Tandem parking.
1. For commercial uses, tandem parking spaces shall be counted as one space unless there is a valet attendant
in charge of the operation of the parking facility during all operating hours, and such requirement is
established through a restrictive covenant. All restrictive covenants and other documents required to be
recorded shall be on city approved forms, and recorded in the public records.
2. For residential uses, tandem parking, if provided, may count as two spaces, provided both spaces are
dedicated to the same residential unit, and a restrictive covenant is recorded on city approved forms, and
recorded in the public records.

approved by the city parking administrator and the city traffic engineer. Only full length parking spaces located
immediately along the proposed development's lot frontages may be counted.
g. Off-site parking. Off-site parking shall be permitted. Off-site parking may count toward required parking, and shall
comply with the following conditions:
1. Off-site parking shall be located within 700 feet of the proposed development. The distance separation shall
be measured by following a straight line from the property line on which the primary use is located to the
property line where the off-site parking is proposed.
2. A restrictive covenant shall be required for the purpose of ensuring that the required parking is provided.
Such restrictive covenant shall be executed by owners of the properties concerned. All restrictive covenants
and other documents required to be recorded shall be on city approved forms, and recorded in the public
records.
3. The location and number of off-site parking spaces shall require approval by DAC.
h. Payment-in-lieu. Proposed developments within the DMP may accommodate their required parking by making
payment for each required parking space into the downtown parking trust fund. The fee per parking space is based
upon the current construction cost of structured parking, as determined by the city parking administrator, and paid at
the time of building permit application. Payment into the downtown parking trust fund is not payment for and does
not provide the right to any parking space(s) in any city facility.
i. Bicycle racks and bicycle storage. In support of a variety of sustainable transit options in the downtown area, bicycle
racks and storage shall be required as follows:
1. Bicycle racks and bicycle storage for commercial uses. Commercial developments, including hotel uses, shall

15 parking spaces provided. Required residential bicycle parking spaces shall be provided in a secured area,
covered from the elements.
3. Mixed-use developments. Mixed-use developments shall provide secure bicycle parking spaces for both the
commercial, including hotels, and residential components of the development as calculated separately
pursuant to the requirements of this section.
j. Motorcycle parking. Up to eight motorcycle parking spaces may be permitted in lieu of four standard parking spaces
and may count toward the required total parking. A minimum of ten parking spaces shall be provided before any
motorcycle spaces can replace a required parking spaces. Motorcycle shall be a minimum of four feet wide and
eight feet long.
k. Mechanical and automated parking.
1. Parking structures with mechanical parking shall provide a commercial attendant during the operating hours
of the facility. Such operation shall be enforced through a restrictive covenant recorded in the public records.

recorded in the public records.
2. Automated parking shall not be penalized for exceeding the maximum required number of parking spaces
and the additional spaces shall not count toward the FAR calculations.
l. Valet parking. Valet parking may be permitted subject to approval by the city parking administrator. In those cases
where the valet service utilizes existing or proposed on-street parking for drop-off or pick-up, the applicant shall pay
for the use of those occupied spaces in the amount as established by the city and in locations approved by the city
parking administrator.
m. Loading and maneuvering. When provided, loading areas shall comply with the following requirements:
1. Loading for all proposed developments shall occur internal to the building footprint or from the adjacent alley
and shall be visually screened from public view. For existing developments or developments which, due to
their size, cannot accommodate internal circulation as determined by the planning director, and which do not
have alley access, the owner may make arrangements with the city to designate on-street parking as a
loading zone subject to the approval of the city parking administrator.
