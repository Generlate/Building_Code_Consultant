Sec. 94-122. - Clematis waterfront district (CWD).
a. Intent. As the historic retail corridor in downtown, the Clematis waterfront district (CWD) signifies one of the major
community spaces for the city and provides a sense of identity for West Palm Beach.
Within this district, Clematis Street is characterized as a low-scale, pedestrian-oriented street. Existing buildings
contribute to the aesthetic, cultural, historic and economic value of downtown West Palm Beach. The city intends to
create the Clematis Street conservation district (CWD-CD) including all lots fronting Clematis Street between
Rosemary Street and Flagler Street, to preserve the character and scale of these buildings. New buildings and
buildings alterations shall support the character and scale of the district. The park and fountain are integral to the
district's character as it provides a central gathering space for downtown and serves as an extension of the
waterfront.
b. Development characteristics.
1. Terraces in CWD-CD are encouraged to be programmed with activities such as outdoor dining or private
gardens to animate buildings and public spaces.
2. Buildings in CWD-CD include local retailers, small and unique storefronts and buildings with restaurants,
sidewalk cafes, specialty shops, and design stores, with second story retail, night clubs, residential, and
offices uses.
3. Proposed developments in CWD-CD should have unique storefronts, as well as awnings and other shading
devices which reinforce the main individual character of each building.
4. Outdoor restaurant seating is encouraged.
5. Ground floor retail is encouraged throughout the district.
c. CWD subdistricts shall include: CWD-10, CWD-5, and CWD-CD.
d. Subdistrict requirements. Developments shall comply with the following:
a. Table IV-24: CWD-10.
b. Table IV-25: CWD-5.
c. Table IV-26: CWD-CD.
e. Additional subdistrict requirements.
1. Parking.
a. Proposed developments within CWD-CD are not required to provide parking.
f. Special requirements.
a. All proposed developments in CWD-CD shall be subject to a special review by the DAC.
b. All structures within the CWD-CD shall qualify as sending sites for the TDR program.
c. Maximum lot agglomeration within the CWD-CD is 25,000 square feet.
d. Towers shall be oriented away from Clematis Street to preserve the scale of the corridor.
e. Colonnades shall be limited to Rosemary Avenue building frontages only and shall comply with section 94109 and Table IV-5.
f. Passageways shall provide bollards, landscaping, or any other type of physical barrier where they intersect
with an alley or public right-of-way for the purpose of separating and protecting pedestrians from vehicular
traffic. Passageways may be secured and gated at night to enhance public safety. When such a measure is
taken, all owners shall be required to provide an agreement to the city which specifies the time at which the
passageway shall be closed to the public, provisions for lighting the passageway during these hours, and a
maintenance plan.
g. Pedestrian overhead connections shall be permitted over alleys to connect to parking structures to make the
redevelopment of existing structures in CWD-CD more feasible.
