Sec. 94-135. - Okeechobee Business district (OBD)
a. Intent. The Okeechobee corridor is the traditional business district of downtown, around which office buildings have
historically located. The Okeechobee Business District is intended to attract high intensity office uses to consolidate
the area as an economic center of downtown, and an integral part of the Flagler Financial District. The district is
envisioned to develop with innovative high-rise buildings with smaller floorplates to allow for view corridors, and
compatible with the surrounding high-rise buildings. The district shall function as a connection between the north
and south portions of the city, with enhanced pedestrian crossings, and a large percentage of public open spaces.
b. Development characteristics.
1. Ground floor support services for office uses are encouraged throughout the district.
2. New projects within this district shall encourage the use of alternative modes of transportation to reduce the
use of private vehicles.
c. OBD subdistricts shall include: OBD-5, OBD-25, OBD-25CP, and OBD-12CP. The OBD-25CP and OBD-12CP are
regulated by the CityPlace Commercial Planned Development.
d. Subdistrict requirements. Developments shall comply with the following:
a. Table IV-69: OBD-5.
b. Table IV-70: OBD-25.
e. Additional subdistrict requirements.
1. Uses.
1. Buildings that have a class A office primary use greater than or equal to 75 percent of the total gross
building area shall not be required to provide active use liners above the ground floor, but shall be
required to provide architectural treatment to extend the facade of the office tower such that the office
tower is perceived as having one continuous uninterrupted facade from the ground floor to the top of
the building for 100 percent of the tower building frontage. Parking garages of such buildings may
provide living green walls to screen the parking uses in lieu of active use liners above the ground floor.
2. Special requirements.
1. Tower orientation shall be towards the west side of the properties to open up the views. When more
than one tower is provided, this provision shall apply to the tower with the greatest height and floorplate
area.
2. Parking on exposed roof surfaces will not be permitted within this district.
3. For properties with frontage along Flagler Drive, public open space shall be located adjacent to Flagler
Drive.
4. All new development within this district will be required to implement the following strategies to improve
mobility downtown:
a. If not existing, pedestrian crossings shall be provided at all corners adjacent to proposed
development.
b. Commercial, office and hotel uses shall provide: i) secure bike racks at a ratio of 1 bicycle space
per every 10 parking spaces provided, and ii) a minimum of one shower and changing facility per
every 30,000 sf of net office space, and/or every 50 hotel rooms.
c. All new projects shall provide a freight delivery plan and routes to ensure deliveries do not impact
traffic operation.
d. All new projects shall provide a curb side management plan to prioritize multimodal travel.
e. No travel lanes shall be blocked during peak hour for ingress/egress of parking garages.
f. Additional transportation demand management strategies will be required for those projects
seeking to exceed the soft maximum parking ratios as prescribed by the parking regulations in
sec. 94-111.

5. New developments within the OBD shall obtain LEED Certification from the Leadership on
Environmental Design (LEED) or a similar nationally accredited organization. The following
requirements shall be met:
a. Prior to the submittal for the first building permit for site improvements, including underground
excavation, the developer shall:
1. Register the project with the U.S. Green Building Council or with the respective agency or
institution issuing the equivalent certification.
2. Pay the cost of a LEED accredited professional or a professional accredited by the agency
or institution issuing the equivalent certification, retained by the city, to act as the Green
Development Review Agent (GDRA) until the project receives its certificate of occupancy.
The developer shall establish an escrow account in an amount determined by the city
finance director sufficient to cover the anticipated costs of the GDRA. The GDRA shall have
the following duties:
a. Review the certification plan prepared by the developer. The certification plan shall
include design, construction and operations sections that list the specific credits
(points) that will be included in the development and detail how the credits will be
achieved.
b. Verify that the credits listed in the certification plan are integrated into the demolition of
the existing buildings, if applicable, and the design, construction and operation of the
project should be sufficient to gain the LEED or equivalent certification that is being
sought.
c. Review all building permit submittals for the site, to include resubmittals and revisions,
to ensure compliance with the certification plan.
d. Inspect the project during demolition, construction and prior to the issuance of the
certificate of occupancy to ensure compliance with the certification plan; and
e. Provide the director of development services with monthly status updates in writing.
b. The certificate of occupancy for the project shall not be issued until the GDRA has verified that the
project has been constructed in conformance with the certification plan to achieve the LEED or
equivalent certification.
c. The developer shall pursue the LEED or equivalent certification within six months after the
issuance of the certificate of occupancy and provide written reports updating the director of
development services on the status of the application every six months thereafter until certification
is achieved or for two years, whichever comes first. If after two years LEED or equivalent
certification is not obtained, then the developer shall provide the city with a written report outlining
why LEED certification was not achieved.
d. If the desired certification is not achieved by the developer within two years and the city’s GDRA
has verified that the project has been constructed in conformance with the certification plan to
achieve the LEED or equivalent certification, then the green certification shall be assumed to have
met the density incentive requirements for the project.
e. All application costs associated with pursuit of the certification shall be borne by the developer.
