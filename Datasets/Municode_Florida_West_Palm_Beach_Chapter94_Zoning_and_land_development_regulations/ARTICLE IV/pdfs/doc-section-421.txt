Sec. 94-115. - CityPlace district (CPD).
a. Intent. The CityPlace DRI shall govern the CityPlace district (CPD). CityPlace is characterized as a mixed-used
district, with a primary emphasis on retail along Rosemary Avenue. Its restaurants, entertainment, and retail uses
support the convention center and the nearby CAD and serve as a southern attraction point to the adjacent QBD.
The CPD, north of Okeechobee Boulevard, is primarily low-scale mixed-use, with low-scale residential west of
Rosemary. The low-scale residential provides an alternative housing type not available elsewhere in the downtown,
and should be maintained. The CPD is an existing PD that takes precedence over these regulations.
