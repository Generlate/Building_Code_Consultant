Sec. 94-119. - Quadrille business district (QBD).
a. Intent. The Quadrille business district is intended to be the main office core for downtown, and a link between the
city's two main retail centers: CityPlace and Clematis Street. It includes the greatest capacity for commercial
development and building heights in the downtown and focuses the most intense development along Quadrille
Boulevard to create a signature office corridor. The city will enhance Quadrille Boulevard as an urban parkway
through streetscape improvements. Incentives are offered for the dedication of right-of-way (ROW) which will allow
for the construction of a new road adjacent to the west side of the FEC ROW between Gardenia Street and
Clematis Street. The new road will create a frontage for the QBD and promote an active urban environment.
Proposed development in the QBD should consist of iconic buildings which respect the scale of Clematis Street and
Rosemary Avenue by stepping down building heights along those corridors. Rosemary shall be the main pedestrian
street with active use liners and ground floor active uses. Additionally, this district shall create a strong connection
with the Northwest Neighborhood by extending Douglass Avenue and Division Avenue as either full vehicular use
streets or pedestrian passageways from 2nd Street to Banyan Boulevard.
b. Development characteristics. Building frontages adjacent to Rosemary Avenue shall reinforce the pedestrian
character and activity of the street.
c.
1. Class A office uses are encouraged.
2. Architectural design should be reflective of a signature office district through the use of iconic forms to
promote a unique skyline and to help brand downtown as an office core.
3. High quality buildings materials are encouraged, such as generous glass panels, shading devices or
sunscreens, stone, and metal panels.
4. Transparency in the form of generous glass openings and/or innovative curtain wall systems that range from
transparent to opaque are encouraged to maximize daylighting and views into occupied areas of the buildings
to improve indoor environmental quality (IEQ).
d. QBD subdistricts shall include: QBD-10, QBD-8, QBD-5, and QBD-3.
e. Subdistrict requirements. Developments shall comply with the following:
a. Table IV-17: QBD-10.
b. Table IV-18: QBD-8.
c. Table IV-19: QBD-5.
d. Table IV-20: QBD-3.
f. Additional subdistrict requirements.
1. Uses.
a. Ground floor residential, if provided, shall be raised a minimum of 18 inches above the sidewalk
elevation.
b. For all building frontages, except those adjacent to Rosemary Avenue, buildings that have a class A
office primary use greater than or equal to 60 percent of the total gross building area shall not be
required to provide active use liners above the ground floor, but shall be required to provide
architectural treatment to extend the facade of the office tower such that the office tower is perceived as
having one continuous uninterrupted facade from the ground floor to the top of the building for 100
percent of the tower building frontage
2. Special requirements.
a. Proposed developments fronting the FEC ROW utilizing any incentive program shall accommodate the
new FEC Road pursuant to section 94-133 to create a street frontage for the proposed development.
b. Proposed developments utilizing any incentive program shall accommodate the extension of Division
and Douglas Avenues north of Banyan Boulevard to enhance connectivity to the Northwest
Neighborhood. Division Avenue and Douglass Avenue may be extended as full vehicular use streets or
as pedestrian passageways.

c. Towers should be articulated to extend to the ground floor to accentuate the vertical proportion and the
appearance of a slender tower.
d. Between Banyan Boulevard and Clematis Street, proposed developments shall accommodate
pedestrian cross-block walkways aligned with the Division and Douglas Avenue extensions to enhance
pedestrian circulation.
e. Main building entrances to lobbies and common areas shall have a high quality design entrance
canopy. Double height space lobbies and common areas should be incorporated for class A office uses.
f. Tower orientation shall be toward Quadrille Boulevard. When more than one tower is provided, this
provision shall apply to the tower with the greatest height and floorplate area.
g. Colonnades. Colonnades shall be limited to Rosemary Avenue building frontages only and shall comply
with section 94-109 and Table IV-5.
