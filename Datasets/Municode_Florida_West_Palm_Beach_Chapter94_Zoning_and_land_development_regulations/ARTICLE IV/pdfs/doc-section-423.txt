Sec. 94-117. - Cultural arts district (CAD).
a. Intent. As the main cultural and educational center within the downtown, the district shall be reinforced by the
promotion of additional cultural and educational facilities with campus style development. The district is anchored by

Center. Stronger connectivity among the cultural facilities and CityPlace should be promoted by improving Sapodilla
