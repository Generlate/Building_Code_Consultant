Sec. 94-101. - Intent.
The downtown master plan (DMP) urban regulations implement the downtown master plan element of the comprehensive
plan and govern the downtown master plan area. The intent of the DMP urban regulations is to create a sustainable
downtown with an enhanced quality of life by creating a zoning code which is reflective of the downtown's 13 districts and
their different characteristics.
These urban regulations enable flexible building design by encouraging a variety of uses, heights, and forms. The urban
regulations describe maximum development allowances. The ability to maximize these allowances, however, may depend
on a number of factors including but not limited to:
a. Other regulations of the Code of Ordinances.
b. The physical characteristics of any particular development site.
