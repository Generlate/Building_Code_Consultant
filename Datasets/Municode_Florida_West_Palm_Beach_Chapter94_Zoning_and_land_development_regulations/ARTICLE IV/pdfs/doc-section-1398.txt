Sec. 94-131. - Incentive programs—General.
a. Intent. The intent of the downtown incentive programs is to promote a variety of public benefits such as historic
preservation, the creation of urban open spaces, the construction of office uses, the development of below market
rate housing units, and hotels. The incentive programs will provide additional development capacity for the property
owners in compensation for the public benefit provided. In general terms, the incentive programs allow additional
height and FAR for proposed development projects which provide the specified public benefit. Incentives are
intended to be distributed through the city's TDR program so that there is no net increase in commercial
development in compliance with the city's comprehensive plan and the downtown transportation concurrency
exemption area (TCEA).
b. General standards.
1. Proposed developments using an incentive program shall be subject to all requirements and conditions of this
chapter.
2. Proposed developments using an incentive program shall comply with the particular TDR receiving site
designation indicated in Figure IV-35 and its corresponding incentive building requirement table, as set forth
in Tables IV-42 through IV-68.
3. Multiple incentives may be used together in conjunction with development, unless otherwise prohibited by this
chapter.
4. Total increases in height or FAR permitted by one or a combination of incentive programs shall not exceed
the maximum height or FAR as established by Figure IV-35 and the corresponding incentive building
requirement table.
5. Designated historic properties, conservation districts, and properties eligible for historic designation, shall not
be eligible for incentives which increase height or FAR unless all eligible historic structures located within the
subject site are preserved according to the secretary of interior standards, and integrated as part of the new
development in a manner which maintains the integrity of the historic structure.
6. Lots on which buildings eligible for designation as historic structures exist as of June 29, 2009, shall not be
eligible for any incentive program if such eligible historic structures are demolished. Table IV-41 Eligible
sending sites, maintained by the historic preservation division and updated from time to time, identifies all
the buildings eligible for historic designation within the downtown master plan area.
7. For properties indicated as containing a future ROW in Figure 4 of the Zoning Atlas, there is no obligation to
dedicate such ROW unless the property owner elects to use the applicable incentive program. If an incentive
program is used, the actual dedication of the future right of way shall occur prior to the issuance of final
CO. The city may elect to design the future ROW as either a full vehicular use street or as a pedestrian
passageway. In some cases, the city may accept a public access easement in lieu of a right of way
dedication.
