Sec. 94-334. - Fees and charges.
a. Fees. Fees for all applications required by this chapter shall be established by resolution of the city commission, as
may be amended from time to time.
b. Supplemental review. The city reserves the right to require a supplemental review for any type of collocation,
attachment, mitigated tower, new tower, or antenna element when determined by the city to be necessary due to
the complexity of the methodology or analysis required to review an application for any proposed or existing
wireless communications facility. The cost to the city for such supplemental technical review shall be borne by the
registrant/applicant and be in addition to other applicable fees.
c. The city may withhold the issuance of any permits to a registrant until any amount past due from registrant to city is
paid in full.
