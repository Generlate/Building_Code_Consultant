Sec. 94-309. - Miscellaneous supplemental district regulations.
a. Exterior lighting. All outdoor lighting shall be shielded to reduce glare and shall be arranged to reflect light or glare
away from all adjacent residential districts, adjacent residences, or public thoroughfares. Illumination of signs shall
be in accordance with the provisions of ARTICLE XIII of this chapter.
b. Residential development entrances. In all residential districts, residential development entrance structures, including
but not limited to walls, columns, and gates, may be located in a required setback, except as provided in section 94305. Compliance with applicable codes and appropriate approvals and permits are required for all residential
entrances. (Note: See Figure X-1)
c. Accessibility. All lots shall be accessible, via public streets, public rights-of-way, private streets, or easements
approved by the city, in order for any use permitted by this chapter to occur.
d. Interpretation of use. Any use not specifically identified as a use permitted by right, a special use, a permitted use
with extra requirements, or a permitted accessory use in a zoning district may be permitted upon a positive
recommendation of the planning and zoning administrator. The planning and zoning administrator shall determine
that a proposed use is similar in nature and compatible with the permitted uses for a district. The determination by
the planning and zoning administrator shall be based upon the Standard Industrial Code (SIC) groupings, as
prepared by the United States Department of Commerce, ARTICLE XIX of this chapter regarding definitions and
APPENDIX A to this chapter containing the master use list, and characteristics shared by existing and proposed
uses including daily traffic generation, types of merchandise or service provided, types of goods produced,
expected hours of operation, and esthetic characteristics. The planning and zoning administrator shall determine
whether such uses shall be permitted by right, permitted as special uses, permitted as uses with extra
requirements, or permitted as accessory uses. A proposed use shall comply with all requirements applicable to
existing uses. A record shall be kept of all uses approved under the provisions of this section. Once a specific use
has been permitted within a district, appropriate amendments to this chapter shall be made as necessary.
e. Voting places. The provisions of this section shall not interfere with the temporary use of any property as a voting
place in connection with public elections.
f. Submerged lands density calculation. In the event any property in a multifamily residential zoning district which
abuts the waters of Lake Worth owns submerged lands in fee simple, such submerged lands may be utilized to
determine ultimate development potential subject to all of the following:
1. Proof of submerged land ownership shall be provided.
2. The applicant will provide a statement concurrent with land development application or building permit
application, in a form acceptable to the city attorney, that an application to fill and utilize submerged lands will
not be filled following approval of the planned development district or issuance of building permit. However,
nothing in this section shall prohibit such water related uses as swimming, fishing, and boating.
3. The density attributed to submerged lands shall be allowed to be utilized with upland density. The number of
units allowed to be added to the upland density is the lesser of 75 percent of the density attributed to the
submerge land or 12Â½ percent of the upland density. Density sought in excess of this formula may be placed
upon upland by application for a PDD. Upland is land that has a bulkhead, and if not a bulkhead, then the
mean high water line on the shore.
4. Any property with an aggregate of upland and submerged acreage of two acres or more may apply for a PDD
in order to increase the utilization of submerge land. The amount of submerged land to be used in
determining ultimate development potential shall not exceed the gross square footage of upland property.
g. Townhouses.
1. Construction permitted. Townhouses may be constructed in the following residential zoning districts: MF14,
MF20 and MF32.
2. Density permitted. The number of townhouses permitted shall not exceed the number of dwelling units per
acre allowed by right or as a planned development in the underlying zoning district.
3. Common ownership. Common ownership of certain property within a townhouse development shall be
allowed; however, at least 100 percent of the ground floor building area of each unit shall be conveyed to the
owner in fee simple title. In the event less than 100 percent of the lot area is, conveyed to the owners of the

Zoning and Land Development Code

units, a property owners association shall be established to provide for the maintenance of all common areas.
In the event 100 percent of the lot area is conveyed to the owners of the units, then a property owners
maintenance association shall be established to ensure compliance with regulations that are adopted for
exterior area maintenance.
4. Minimum number of units. At least eight townhouse units must be constructed if a property owners'
association for common area maintenance is to be established.
