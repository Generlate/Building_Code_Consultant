Sec. 94-210. - Northwood mixed-use district (NMUD).
a. Intent. The Northwood mixed-use district (NMUD) is a compact, pedestrian-oriented, mixed-use district that serves
Northwood, Pleasant City and other surrounding areas. This mixed-use district is characterized as having
historically significant buildings with an eclectic mix of businesses, artist studios and shops. It provides for urban
types of development regulations concerning setbacks, parking requirements and location, height limitations and
permitted uses. The intent of the development standards for the Northwood mixed-use district is to reinforce the
existing architectural character; to create a place of common vision and physical predictability for all new
construction and renovations; to provide areas for the concentration of compatible land uses that are
complementary to the surrounding neighborhoods; and to encourage historic preservation and a pedestrian friendly
transit-oriented environment.
b. District boundaries. The development standards shall be utilized for properties located within the Northwood mixeduse district. The Northwood mixed-use district is generally bounded on the north by the alley north of 25th Street;
Dixie Highway to the east; 23rd Street to the south; and the F.E.C. Railroad Tracks to the west.
c. Administration. In order to maintain predictability in development, planned developments and variances to increase
building height or add stories are prohibited.
Variances from the dimensional requirements or waivers from any other criterion or special review projects may be
approved by the planning board or the historic preservation board, provided that the applicant meets the standards
pertaining to such variance or waiver. The planning board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is
an error in any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by the planning and zoning administrator in the
enforcement of these development regulations.
d. General development standards .
1. In addition to the standards contained in this section, the standards in Section 94-209 Mixed Use (MU) district
standards shall be applicable to development within the Northwood mixed-use district (MNUD).
2. The Northwood mixed-use district (NMUD) regulations consists of the regulating plans, diagrams and these
mixed-use regulations.
3. The provisions of the NMUD regulations, when in conflict, shall take precedence over the general zoning and
land development regulations.
4. The provisions of the building code, when in conflict, shall take precedence over the provisions of the NMUD
regulations.
5. Existing buildings may not be destroyed or removed until a building permit has been issued for a replacement
building which complies with the NMUD regulations.
6. Existing buildings and uses within the NMUD area, which were legally established but do not conform to
current provisions of the NMUD regulations shall be considered legal nonconforming and may not be
replaced, restored, or modified, except in conformity with the NMUD regulations, and shall follow the
regulation for nonconformities contained in ARTICLE XVI of this chapter. When a legal nonconforming
structure is destroyed by windstorm, flood, or natural disaster, it may be replaced by a new structure of the
same or lesser size, and reoccupied by the same use, if construction of such structure is commenced within
18 months of destruction.
7. Proposed development with a site plan approved under the 2002 NMUD regulations shall commence
construction within the time frame allotted in the development order or site plan approval letter. If
commencement of construction does not occur within the allotted time frame, the site plan approval shall
automatically expire without further action by the city.
8. Surface parking. New permanent surface parking lots shall only be permitted on existing vacant lots that are
owned by the city and/or the CRA or behind buildings that are consistent with the Northwood mixed-use
district code requirements.
e. Civic buildings. The design of civic buildings shall be subject to these regulations.
f. Regulating plans and diagrams. The NMUD is governed by a series of regulating plans and diagrams. The
regulating plans and diagrams demonstrate NMUD development standards in both words and diagrams, and

Zoning and Land Development Code

Page 1

include maps designating the locations where the various standards apply. Unless otherwise noted, all development
shall be in compliance with the regulating plans and diagrams. The regulating plans and diagrams for the NMUD
include the following:
1. The sub-districts regulating plan, which divides the NMUD into three subdistricts: core, transition and edge.
The highest height within the NMUD shall be allocated to the core sub-district. The height shall then gradually
decrease from the core to the height and number of stories in the transition sub-district and then further
decrease to the edge sub-district which is characterized by single uses adjacent to existing low density
residential. The sub-districts regulating plan is shown in Figure VII-1.
2. The building heights regulating plan, which establishes the maximum building height as shown in Figure VII2.
3. The designated open spaces and urban greenway systems regulating plan, which designates the required
public open space and urban greenway system as shown in Figure VII-3.
4. The street network connectivity regulating plan, which shows the location of existing and the required new
streets needed to create the prescribed network of streets within the NMUD. This plan also establishes the
hierarchy of the streets as shown in Figure VII-4.
5. The building typology and placement regulating diagrams, which provide a schematic representation of the
various building typologies. The diagrams demonstrate the required lot standards and profiles of structures.
The building typology and placement regulating diagrams are shown in Figures VII-5 through VII-12.

and oriented toward a specified Primary Street, Urban Greenway or Designated Open Space.
3. Lot standards. Lot standards, including but not limited to lot dimensions and impervious surface area, are
determined based on the selected building typology. Table VII-8 lists the lot standards.
