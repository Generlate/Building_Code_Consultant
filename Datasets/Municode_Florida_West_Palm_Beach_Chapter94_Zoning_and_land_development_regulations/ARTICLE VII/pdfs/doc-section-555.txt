Sec. 94-228. - Coleman Park Historic District professional office residential (CP - POR
C2) development characteristics and sub-district requirements.
a. Intent. The intent of this district is to preserve its existing residential scale and character of the district and to provide
opportunities to attract established businesses as well as incubate and develop new businesses. Because the
properties in this district have historic designation, redevelopment in existing structures would be confined to interior
build-outs necessary for the change in occupancy demanded by the newly established commercial use. Changes to
the exterior of any structure or additions will require prior approval from the city's historic preservation division.
b. Property development regulations. Building requirements for structures within the Coleman Park Historic District
professional office residential area shall comply with the requirements for historic single-family high density
residential, context 2, established in section 94-81.
c. Parking. All parking shall be placed behind the building. One standard parking space is required for each 1,000
square feet of office space. One standard parking space shall be provided for each dwelling unit. On-street parking
adjacent to the property may be counted toward the required parking.
d. Building uses. Uses permitted within this district are provided in the schedule of permitted uses under professional
office residential (POR) zoning district in table 1-IX of ARTICLE IX of this chapter.
e. Architectural standards. Structures within this district shall adhere to the design standards established in section 9479.
