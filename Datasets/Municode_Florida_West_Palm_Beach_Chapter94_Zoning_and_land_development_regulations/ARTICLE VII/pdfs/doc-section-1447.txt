Sec. 94-215. - Currie mixed use district (CMUD).
a. Intent. The Currie Mixed Use District (CMUD) is a compact, pedestrian-oriented, mixed-use district located between
Currie Park (to the east), and the Northwood business district (to the west). Unlike the suburban residential and
shopping areas, this type of mixed-use district requires urban types of development regulations concerning
setbacks, parking requirements and location, height limitations, and permitted uses. The intent of the development
standards for the CMUD is to create a predictable, urban neighborhood that adds vitality and additional local users
to the adjacent Currie Park and Northwood business district.
b. District Boundaries. The development standards of this section shall be utilized for properties located within the
CMUD. The CMUD generally consists of the properties east of Dixie Highway, west of Flagler Drive, north of 27th
Street, extending to the south side of Pine Street.
c. Administration. In order to maintain predictability in development, planned developments and variances to increase
building height are prohibited. Variances from the dimensional requirements or waivers from any other criterion may
be approved by the planning board, provided that the applicant meets the standards pertaining to such variance or
waiver. The applicable board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is an error in any order,
requirement, decision, or determination made by the development services director in the enforcement of these
development regulations.
d. General Development Standards.
1. In addition to the standards contained in this section, the standards in section 94-209 Mixed-use (MU) district
standards shall be applicable to development within the CMUD.
2. The CMUD regulations consists of regulating plans, the regulations provided in this section and the MU
district standards provided in Section 94-209.
3. The provisions of the CMUD regulations, when in conflict, shall take precedence over the MU district
standards and the general zoning and land development regulations.
4. The provisions of the building code, when in conflict, shall take precedence over the provisions of the CMUD
regulations.
5. Existing buildings may not be destroyed or removed until a building permit has been issued for a replacement
building which complies with the CMUD regulations.
6. Existing buildings and uses within the CMUD area, which were legally established but do not conform to
current provisions of the CMUD regulations shall be considered legal nonconforming and may not be
replaced, restored, or modified, except in conformity with the CMUD regulations, and shall follow the
regulation for nonconformities contained in ARTICLE XVI of this chapter. A nonconforming use may be
temporarily suspended due to damage by windstorm, flood, or natural disaster, provided application for a
building permit to make repairs is made within six months of the date of the windstorm, flood, or natural
disaster. When a legal nonconforming structure is destroyed by windstorm, flood, or nature disaster, it may be
replaced by a new structure of the same or lesser size, and reoccupied by the same use, provided an
application for a building permit is made within 12 months of destruction.
7. New permanent stand-alone surface parking lots shall only be permitted on existing vacant lots that are
owned by the City and/or the CRA or land donated to the City by the developer for purpose of providing public
parking for Currie Park through the CMUD height incentive program in accordance with Sec. 94-215(k).
e. Regulating Plans. The CMUD is governed by a series of regulating plans. The regulating plans include maps
designating the locations of where the various standards apply. Unless otherwise noted, all development shall be in
compliance with the regulating plans. The regulating plans for the CMUD include the following:
1. The Sub-districts Regulating Plan divides the CMUD into four sub-districts: Core I/IA, Core II, Transition and
Edge. The highest density and intensity within the CMUD shall be allocated to the Core I/IA and II subdistricts, a mixed-use area in the heart of the district. The densities and intensities shall then gradually
decrease from the Core sub-districts to the Transition sub-district where mixed-uses are still permitted, and
then further decrease to the Edge sub-district. The Edge sub-district is predominantly characterized by singlefamily residential use adjacent to existing low-density residential use outside of the district. The sub-districts
regulating plan is shown in Figure VII-21.

2. A separate Currie Parking Fund shall be established by the City. All in-lieu payments
collected by the City, and all interest earned thereon, shall be deposited in this fund and
the funds shall be kept separate from other city funds. The Currie Parking Fund shall be
used solely for the acquisition of land for development and maintenance of public parking
facilities in and/or directly serving the CMUD. Use of such funds shall be determined by
the City Commission. Any monies not expended in the fund in any fiscal year shall be
carried over in the fund into the following year. The assessment to be paid (the “in-lieu
payment”) shall be a one-time payment per space for each parking space required. The
amount of the in-lieu assessment shall be established by resolution of the City
Commission and may be adjusted from time-to-time. The fee per parking space shall be
based on the current construction cost of the structured parking, as determined by the
City’s Parking Administrator, and paid at the time of building permit application.
g. Credit can also be provided to an applicant if the land provided for public boat/vehicular parking
on property located within the Edge, Transition or Core II sub-districts. The credit for the value
of land will be provided at a ratio of $25,000 for every one foot of height as determined by an
appraisal approved by the City. The credit can be transferred to the Transition, Core II, Core I or
Core IA sub-districts.
h. Additional credit can also be provided to an applicant if the public boat/vehicular parking is
constructed by the applicant. The credit for the construction of the parking will be provided at a
ratio of $25,000 for every one foot of height as determined by a cost estimate provided and
approved by the Engineering Services Department of the City.
vi. Payment for Mobility Options. The developer seeking to utilize this incentive will receive additional
height for addressing Transportation Demand Management (TDM) measures as approved by the City
as part of an approval of a project within the CMUD. Should the City desire to fund a trolley system
from the downtown to the CMUD, a developer will receive an additional 13 feet in height with a onetime contribution of $325,000 to the City’s trolley/mobility fund. Other height incentives can be
attained by contributing $25,000 for each one foot of height up to the maximum contribution as

Green Development Review Agent (GDRA) until the project receives its certificate of
occupancy. The developer shall establish an escrow account, in an amount determined by
the finance director, for the GDRA services. The GDRA shall have the following duties:
i. Review the certification plan prepared by the developer. The certification plans shall
include design, construction and operation sections that list the specific credits
(points) that will be included in the development and detail how the credits will be
achieved.
ii. Verify that the credits listed in the certification plan are integrated into the demolition
of the existing buildings, if applicable, and the design, construction and operation of
the project should be sufficient to gain the LEED or equivalent certification that is
being sought.
iii. Review all building permit submittals for the site, to include resubmittals and
revisions, to ensure compliance with the certification plan.
iv. Inspect the project during demolition, construction and prior to the issuance of the
final certificate of occupancy to ensure compliance with the certification plan; and
v. Provide the Development Services Director with written monthly status updates.
3. The certificate of occupancy for the project shall not be issued until the GDRA has verified
that the project has been constructed in conformance with the certification plan to achieve
the LEED or equivalent certification.
4. The developer shall pursue the LEED or equivalent certification within six months after the
issuance of the certificate of occupancy and provide written reports updating the
Development Services Director on the status of the application every six months thereafter
until certification is achieved or for two years, whichever first occurs. If after two years
LEED or equivalent certification is not obtained, then the developer shall provide the City
with a written report outlining why LEED certification was not achieved.
5. All application costs associated with pursuit of the certification shall be borne by the
developer.
viii. Public Open Spaces. The developer seeking to utilize this incentive will receive an additional 30 feet
