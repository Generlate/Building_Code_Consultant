Sec. 94-404. - Legal noncomplying signs.
a. Legal noncomplying signs defined. A legal noncomplying sign is any sign which was legally established pursuant to
the issuance of a sign permit on or before the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived, and
which is rendered noncomplying by the provision of such ordinance or a subsequent amendment thereto. In order
to be considered a legal noncomplying sign, a sign must comply with all applicable regulations in effect at the time it
was erected, including having been issued a sign permit. Signs for which no sign permit was required at the time
they were established and which are rendered noncomplying by the provisions of this article or a subsequent
amendment thereto shall not enjoy legal noncomplying status, but shall be illegal noncomplying signs.
b. Regulations applicable to legal noncomplying signs. Legal noncomplying signs shall be subject to the building and
structural nonconformity provisions of ARTICLE XIV of this chapter and the provisions of this section.
c. Replacement of legal noncomplying sign with another noncomplying sign restricted. The sign face of a legal
noncomplying sign may be changed, replaced, or repaired provided the change, replacement or repair shall not
prolong the life of the sign structure or so as to change the shape or size of the sign. Normal maintenance of
noncomplying signs to preserve structural soundness shall not be prohibited.
d. Alteration of noncomplying message prohibited. No sign with a noncomplying commercial message shall have any
changes made in the words or symbols which would result in a different noncomplying commercial message unless
the sign is a billboard, an off-premises advertising sign, a bulletin board, or substantially similar type of sign,
specifically designed for periodic change of message.
e. Removal of damaged noncomplying signs. No noncomplying sign shall be reconstructed or repaired to a
noncomplying state after damage or destruction if the cost of reconstruction exceeds 50 percent of the replacement
cost of the sign. Damaged noncomplying signs which may not be reconstructed or repaired under the terms of this
article shall be removed immediately.
f. Removal of obsolete noncomplying signs. Obsolete signs which are noncomplying in their number, size or
placement shall be removed not less than 30 days after becoming obsolete. An obsolete sign is hereby defined as
any such sign which no longer correctly directs or exhorts any person; or which advertises a business, service,
product or activity no longer conducted, available or in the case of on-premises signs, or on any lot in the case of
off-premises signs.
g. Removal of legal noncomplying signs. Any sign which may become noncomplying as a result of this article or any
amendment to this article may be continued in operation and maintained indefinitely as a legal noncomplying sign,
provided that:
1. No structural alteration, enlargement, or extension shall be made to a legal noncomplying sign unless the
structural alteration, enlargement, or extension will result in the elimination of the noncomplying features of
the sign.
2. No sign shall be moved in whole or in part to any other location where it would remain noncomplying.
3. If a legal noncomplying sign is damaged or destroyed by any means to the extent of 50 percent or more of its
replacement value at the time of the damage, the sign may not be rebuilt or used thereafter unless it
conforms to all of the provisions of this ordinance. In the event the damage or destruction is less than 50
percent of its replacement value at the time, the sign may be rebuilt to its original condition and may continue
to be displayed.
4. Normal maintenance of legal noncomplying signs, including necessary nonstructural repairs and incidental
work which does not extend or intensify the noncomplying features of the sign, shall be permitted.
5. Billboards
a. Any billboards within the City of West Palm Beach, with exception of those located within 350 feet of the
main line of Interstate 95, existing before March 9, 1998, may be relocated adjacent to Interstate 95 by
March 23, 2007, subject to the approval of a Class A special use permit prior to applying for a billboard
sign permit with the construction services department. The city commission may grant waivers of the
additional standards if the request is found consistent with the waiver standards outlined in subsection
94-273(a)(2). All distance requirements provided in this section shall be measured from the furthest
projection of the structure.
