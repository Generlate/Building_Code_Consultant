Sec. 94-141. - Intent.
The intent of the citywide commercial districts is to allow a variety of commercial uses in selected areas throughout the
city. The locations of commercial uses will vary depending on the intensity of use, existing patterns of use and proximity to
existing or anticipated residential development. The commercial districts also will allow a wide range of commercial
activities to be offered to city residents.
